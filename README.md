# Interactive Machine Learning

## Overview
This repo focuses on experiments in interactive ML, where users are part of the training or decision loop—labeling, correcting, or guiding AI behavior.

## Why This Matters
Interactive ML enables adaptive systems that learn with users, not just from static data. It makes models more flexible, personalized, and responsive.

## Projects
- Active learning interface for medical images
- Real-time model tuning with human input
- Feedback loops to retrain lightweight models

##  Tools & Technologies
Python · Streamlit · Scikit-learn · PyTorch · Jupyter · Active Learning

## Goals
- Reduce human effort via smarter interaction
- Build AI that evolves with user preferences
- Prototype collaborative ML workflows
